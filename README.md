Create react app starter files, with LESS configured. See sections below for how to run and use the app.

**Note:** You can checkout the [react + webpack5 starter kit](https://github.com/Ifycode/react-webpack5-starter-kit) instead, if you want something other than create react app.

Install dependencies with the yarn command below if you are using yarn, or install dependencies with the npm command below if you are using npm.

````
